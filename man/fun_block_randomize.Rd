\title{Generate Random Assignments for Block-Randomized Design}
\usage{
fun_block_randomize(n, block_size, arms = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Numeric. The total number of subjects or units to assign.}

\item{block_size}{Numeric. The size of each block.}

\item{arms}{Numeric. The number of treatment arms (default is 6).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n}, containing the randomized assignments to treatment arms.
}
\description{
Generates a vector of randomized assignments for a block-randomized design with a specified number of treatment arms. The function handles cases where the block size is not a multiple of the number of arms by including incomplete repetitions within the block.
}
\details{
The function generates random assignments within blocks of size \code{block_size}. Each block contains complete repetitions of the treatment arms, and if \code{block_size} is not a multiple of \code{arms}, it includes an incomplete repetition with randomly selected arms. The assignments within each block are randomly shuffled.

If the total number of subjects \code{n} is not an exact multiple of \code{block_size}, the function generates enough blocks to cover all subjects and trims the result to length \code{n}.
}
\note{
A warning is issued if \code{block_size} is not a multiple of \code{arms}.

\examples{
# Example usage:
assignments <- fun_block_randomize(n = 100, block_size = 20, arms = 6)
table(assignments)

# With block size not a multiple of arms
assignments <- fun_block_randomize(n = 50, block_size = 17, arms = 5)
table(assignments)
